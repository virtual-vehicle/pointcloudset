Getting started
===============================

* Install VS Code
* Install the remote development extension in VS code (ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack)
* Install and run docker desktop
* Clone the repository (you can use VS code for that as well)
* Open the folder in VS code
* VS code asks to open the remote development environment - say yes
* The docker image is download on the first start, so this may take a while
